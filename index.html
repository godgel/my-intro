    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.
    </p>
    What is HTML?
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper
      <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>Language.</strong> It's a markup language that web
      developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
      programming language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>

    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts: </p>
      <ol> 
        <li> First</li>
        <li> The opening tag </li>
        <li> The closing tag </li>
        <li> The actual element </li>
      </ol>

     <p> You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.</p>
    

    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:

      To be able to use the fundamental web dev language
      To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix
      To build web applications
      To impress friends
      To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ
      
      Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!
